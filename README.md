The contents of this file contain the tiebreaker program for the college football programs in the Atlantic Coast Conference from 2023 to 2025.
# All valid tiebreakers must follow the following rules in the scenario that two teams are tied with each other:
## 1. If the teams played each other, the team that won the game would win the tiebreaker.
## 2. The team with the higher win percentage against common conference opponents would win the tiebreaker.
## 3. The team that beat more higher-ranked common conference opponents than the other team would win the tiebreaker.
## 4. The team with a stronger in-conference strength of schedule than the other team would win the tiebreaker.
## 5. The team with a higher Team Rating Score from SportSource Analytics than the other team would win the tiebreaker. (Can be skipped if you aren't willing to pay for these)
## 6. The team that is randomly selected over the other team will win the tiebreaker. (Simulates a random draw by the ACC commissioner)  
# All valid tiebreakers must follow the following rules in the scenario that three or more teams are tied with each other:
## 1. If all tied teams played each other, the team that beat the most tied teams wins the tiebreaker.
## 2. If not all tied teams played each other, then any team that played and defeated all tied teams wins the tiebreaker.
  -- If any team played and lost to all tied teams, that team is removed from the tiebreaker.
## 3. The team with the higher win percentage against common conference opponents would win the tiebreaker.
## 4. The team that beat more higher-ranked common conference opponents than the other team would win the tiebreaker.
## 5. The team with a stronger in-conference strength of schedule than the other team would win the tiebreaker.
## 6. The team with a higher Team Rating Score from SportSource Analytics than the other team would win the tiebreaker. (Can be skipped if you aren't willing to pay for these)
## 7. The team that is randomly selected over the other team will win the tiebreaker. (Simulates a random draw by the ACC commissioner)
### Note: If any of these rules reduces the number of tied teams, restart the tiebreaker without the removed teams after the current rule has been completed.
